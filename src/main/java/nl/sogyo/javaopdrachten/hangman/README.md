## **Hangman (Required)**
Hangman is a guessing game in which the user guesses a word randomly picked from a list of words. The user guesses a letter. If it’s contained in the word, the corresponding letters in the word are shown. If it’s not in the word, the user loses a guess. After 10 wrong guesses, the computer wins.
