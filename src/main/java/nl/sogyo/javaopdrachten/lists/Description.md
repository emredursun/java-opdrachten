## **Lists (Required)**
This assignment is about manipulating lists and arrays. Implement your own algorithms to find the highest value or lowest value in a list. Do not use the built-in functions on arrays and lists for this.

1. Create a program that will initialize an array with 10 random numbers between 0 and 100. Display the list.

2. The highest. Expand your program so that the highest value in your array will be displayed.

3. The lowest two. Expand your program so that the result of adding the two lowest values in the array will be displayed.

4. Filter. Expand your program to display all values that are even.

5. Split. Expand your program to generate four list. In the first list should contain all numbers that can be divided by 2, the second numbers tha can be divided by 3, the third list should contain numbers that can be divided by 5, and the final list should contain the remaining numbers.

6. Sort. Expand your program so that it will display the result of sorting the numbers in the array in ascending order. Use the BubbleSort algorithm.
